# Password Creator 

## Project Detials
This Project was to use the javascript we learned to create a password genorator and a interactive page.

# Why
This demonstrates that there is more levels of polish and interaction that can be implimented onto a webpage allowing for more creativity and input from the user.
This Password Creator serves a direct purpose for the user allowing them to input specifications and then receive something off of their own specifications.

# Problems
I didn't run into many problems. I was stuck for a time on trying to figure out how to see where things got hung up and once a TA reminded me i could console log
out information it made debugging much easier to see where things were.
The homework for this week helped solve almost all of my issues directly.


# Problems Solved
-Generated prompts for what characters are included 
-corrects if incorrect input for amopunt of characters so must be between 8 and 128
-the character set is responsive to user inputs only choosing from what they select.
-displays generated password once complete.


# Takaways
I need to understandthe math functions and prompt types better
I am more comfertable with java than i thought i would be
I want to figure out how to do the selections without so many if else statements
